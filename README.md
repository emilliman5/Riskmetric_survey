# Riskmetric_survey
App to survey R users about the perceived risk of R packages

In an effort to be data-driven in assessing the risk of a package we are creating a survey to score the top ~500 packages downloaded from CRAN.

For a discussion on how packages were surveyed <a href="https://emilliman5.github.io/Riskmetric_survey/Package_selection.html" title="Package selection">click here</a>
